    <p> <hr/> </p>  
    <h4>With over 5 years of experience as a website developer, I specialize in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. My background includes a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from XYZ University and expertise in both front-end and back-end development. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and have extensive experience with modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. My proficiency also extends to backend technologies, including Node.js, Express, and databases such as MySQL and MongoDB. My passion for technology and attention to detail drive my continuous learning and adaptation to industry trends.

        In my previous role at ABC Solutions, I led a team of developers, significantly improving website performance and user engagement through innovative UI/UX designs. My ability to communicate effectively with designers, project managers, and clients has consistently resulted in successful project outcomes that exceed expectations. I am now looking for new opportunities to leverage my technical skills and creativity in a dynamic team, contributing to impactful digital solutions while embracing the latest technological advancements.</h4>
